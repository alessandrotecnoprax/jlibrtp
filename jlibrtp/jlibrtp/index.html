<h2><a name="abstract">Abstract</a></h2>

<p>We have created a library that partially implements the Real-Time Transport Protocol (RTP), 
a well-established standard for streaming media across IP-based networks, in Java. The purpose 
of this library is to make it easy for application developers to create applications for peer 
to peer streaming of audio, video and other data. In addition, developers will need a protocol 
to establish contact with peers, such as Session Initialization Protocol (SIP).</p>

<p>Our library accepts any kind of binary data, handles packet parsing and reordering, maintains a 
participant database and the control connection associated with the protocol. The application 
is notified of received data through a callback-interface. The library supports IPv4, IPv6 and 
multicast. It does currently not support encryption, and should not be used in cases where 
confidentiality is important.</p>

<h2><a name="introduction">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>jlibrtp partially implements the Real-Time Transport Protocol (RTP, RFC 3550)<a href="#1">[1]</a>. 
It is an alternative to the RTP stack provided by Sun Microsystems (R) in the Java Media Framework 
(JMF)<a href="#2">[2]</a>,  the difference is that we attempt to provide application developers with a much 
simpler application programming interface (API).</p>

<p>To use jlibrtp, developers must instatiate a copy of the RTPSession class and provide a class 
that implements the callback interface RTPAppIntf. The RTPSession object is a container for the 
datastructures required by the library,  and starts the threads used for receiving and parsing 
packets. The program can use simple methods to add peers, participants  that send or receive 
packets, to the session. The callback interface is called whenever the stack has data ready for 
the application, and it is up to the developer to decide what to do with the binary data.</p>

<p>Our code is licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL)<a href="#3">[3]</a>, 
developers are therefore free to change functionality or provide a richer API if the current implementation 
does not meet their needs.</p>

</p><h2><a name="related_work">Related Work</a></h2>
<p>The Java Media Framework provides much of the same functionality as jlibrtp, 
but requires the application developer to do considerably more work and cannot 
easily be modified to accomodate special requirements.</p>

<p>JRTP<a href="#4">[4]</a> is a framework for media distribution that also includes RTP. 
However, it is a  comprehensive program for the distribution of content, such as television, 
and the RTP component is not designed to be used separately. It appears that it was
last modified in 1997 and is therefore probably outdated.</p>

<p>java.net.rtp<a href="#5">[5]</a> is a relatively old application specialized for a
whiteboard application. It only supports multicast, which currently severly limits its 
usefulness in common VoIP applications, and lacks the datastructures to 
handle separate streams.</p>

<p>There are several RTP stacks available in C and C++, including GNU Telephony's ccRTP<a href="#6">[6]</a></p>

</p><h2><a name="background">Background</a></h2>

<p>RTP is often used to refer to both the data (RTP packets) and the associated 
signalling protocol, RTCP (Real-Time Transport Control Protocol). Less sophisticated applications 
are generally only concerned with the data. RTCP provides functionality to monitor the flow of data
and generates statistics for both senders and receivers. This information can be used to limit
the bandwidth used, by detecting the loss of packets. Clients could for example switch to a more
compact encoding scheme so that everyone in a session is able to keep up.</p>
<p>The two sub-protocols operate on separate UDP ports (uni- or multicast), both of which must be 
communicated to peers through a medium like SIP (Session Initialization Protocol).</p>

<h3><a name="demo_application">Demonstration Application</a></h3>
<p>The source code includes receiverDemo.java and senderDemo.java. They are 
designed to stream 8kHz PCM mono sound from the sender to the receiver. Note 
that it is difficult to stream sound files in Java, the timer is not accurate 
enough to ensure timely tranmission and the Java Media Framework does not guarantee 
that the receiver will block, when writing to the sound stream, if the packets 
arrive too quickly. One way to fix this is to also play the sound on the sender, 
which ensures that it blocks for the right amount of time before sending the next packet.</p> 
<p>Readers are encouraged to look at them and modify them, certain parameters 
(such as audio-format) have been hardcoded intentionally to limit the number of 
parameters (and sources of confusion) that are needed. Running the program without
any parameters explains the required parameters.</p>

<h3><a name="security">Security</a></h3>
Java inherently provides some protection against buffer overflows and other common problems. 
Additionally, packet buffer size is automatically limited to 2000 octets. Developers / users can 
choose whether packets from unknown sources should be returned to the application or discarded.

Our library does not implement encryption according to the Secure RTP (SRTP, RFC)[] specifications, 
and therefore provides no confidentiality. All streams can be played by anyone able to intercept the packets.

<h2><a name="measurements">Measurements</a></h2>
<h3><a name="interoperability">Interoperability</a></h3>
The library has been validated in three ways. First, we have looped packets through the library to 
verify that the parsing is correct

<h3><a name="performance">Performance</a></h3>
We tested the library by streaming raw audio (44.1kHz, 16 bit, stereo, 1kbyte packets) across the loopback interface, 
i.e. the same instance of the library was both sending and receiving. The test system (2.13 GHz, 
Linux 2.6.17, Java 1.5.0) had no problems handling the 2.8 Mbps. While packet parsing is expensive 
in Java, due to lack of pointers and unsigned integers, this would be more than sufficient to stream video.
